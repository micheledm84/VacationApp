This is a very basic web application to manage holidays and days of leave.

It is written with PHP, JavaScript, HTML and CSS (Bootstrap 3).

The database used is MySQL.

You can find the application in the following url:

https://vacationapp.000webhostapp.com

user and pwd: "admin" (you will have admin permissions... edit the data freely).

If you have some ideas to implement send me an email to "michele.dellamea.99@gmail.com".
